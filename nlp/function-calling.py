"""
A simple example of function calling with OpenAI.
We use a get_current_weather function to demonstrate the OpenAI API's ability to call external functions that we define.
It is easy to imagine how much more powerful this could be with a variety of different functions.

Note: This script is simply for learning and demonstration purposes. 
In practice, you would not "hard-code" LLM conversation as we are. 
Libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex are designed to make this process much easier.

Run with: 
python3 weather-llm.py
